    "description": "Claire Silver is an AI-collaborative artist, cryptopunk, and believer in NFTs. Her work explores themes of vulnerability, trauma, disability, social hierarchy, digital identity, innocence, and divinity, and questions the role they will play in our transhumanist future. She does not make statements on whether AI is 'good' or 'bad'. She is a caveman painting fire. Apart from a successful career in NFTs, Claire has had work in Times Square, been featured in WIRED, and will be extensively interviewed in an upcoming documentary on NFTs.",
