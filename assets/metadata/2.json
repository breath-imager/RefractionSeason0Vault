    "description": "Cibelle Cavalli Bastos is an artist, musician, independent researcher and activist who lives and works between Berlin, São Paulo and London. Their practice as research engages with the changing conceptualization of identity, performativity, pictorial communication and the propagation of behavioral patterns in the digital age. It observes the challenges to perception and cognition under a white-supremacist cis-hetero-normative patriarchal psyche turbo-powered by platform capitalism and explores how counter-discourses, that challenge dominant narratives around sociopolitical issues, can be embedded or used as a form of resistance against the propagation of algorithmic behavior both IRL and the digital sphere.",
